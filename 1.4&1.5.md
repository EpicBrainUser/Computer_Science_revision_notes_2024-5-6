**Computing 1.4/1.5 Revision**

**1.4.1:**  
Malware: Software (executables) designed to do harm  
Virus:

* Replicates by modifying files and inserting malicious code into other programs.  
* Requires user action to spread, such as opening infected files or email attachments.  
* Can corrupt files, damage system data, and consume system resources.  
* Can spread via infected programs, files, or external storage devices.  
* Often designed to execute a specific payload, like corrupting data or stealing information.

Worm:

* A self-replicating malware that spreads autonomously without requiring user interaction.  
* Uses network connections to infect other computers and devices, often exploiting security vulnerabilities.  
* Can overload systems and networks with excessive traffic.  
* Often spreads through email or file-sharing systems.  
* May cause harm like data loss, system crashes, or creating a backdoor for further attacks.

Trojan (horse):

* Disguises itself as legitimate software or a trusted file to deceive the user.  
* Does not replicate itself like viruses or worms; it requires user initiation to infect the system.  
* Creates a backdoor on the infected device, allowing unauthorized access for attackers.  
* Can carry a payload, such as ransomware or spyware, to steal sensitive data or cause other damage.  
* Often delivered through seemingly harmless downloads, emails, or websites.

Social Engineering:

- Social engineering is the ability to obtain confidential information by asking people for it  
- “Shoulder surfing” is the ability to get information or passwords by observing someone.  
- Phishing:  
  - Illegitimate email address: The sender's email address (123459876@ureg.edu.ru) does not resemble the legitimate email address of the bank (Direct Banking). The domain ".ru" is associated with Russia, which is suspicious if the bank is not located in Russia.  
  - Poor spelling and grammar: The email contains errors such as “will no long processes” and “untill,” which are common indicators of phishing emails. Professional organizations, especially banks, typically send emails with proper grammar and spelling.  
  - Non-personalized email: The email does not address the recipient by name, which is unusual for legitimate communication from a bank. Phishing emails often send mass messages without personalization to target many victims.  
  - Suspicious tone and urgency: Phishing emails often create a sense of urgency or pressure to act quickly. The lack of personalization and the suspicious nature of the email’s content suggest it's attempting to deceive you.  
  - Unfamiliar sender: If the bank’s official email doesn’t match the sender's address or if the email domain seems suspicious, it's a red flag. Legitimate businesses typically use their own domains for email communication.  
  - Request for personal information: Phishing emails often ask for sensitive information like login credentials or bank details, which legitimate organizations would never request via email.  
  - No official branding: Phishing emails usually lack the official logo, signature, and branding of the bank, which are commonly present in legitimate communications.  
- SQL Injection:  
  - Structured Query Language  
  - Entering code into “front-end” input fields in order to manipulate “back-end” databases, causing damage  
- DoS and DDoS  
  - A Denial of Service (DoS) attack aims to disrupt access to a network resource by overwhelming a server with traffic, depleting system resources and making the service slow or unresponsive. A Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) is a variation that uses a botnet of multiple computers to flood the target, intensifying the attack. Both prevent legitimate users from accessing the service.

**1.4.2:**

**Penetration Testing (White Hat Hacking)**

* Deliberate practice of finding security holes in systems.  
* Identifies weak points to target and attempts to break into the system.  
* Findings are reported back to improve system security.

**Anti-malware Software**

* Detects and removes malicious software like viruses, worms, trojans, and spyware.  
* When new malware is discovered, a "signature" is created and added to the software’s database.  
* Regular updates and patches help the software detect the latest threats.  
* A continuous "cat-and-mouse" game between malware creators and anti-malware companies.

**Encryption**

* Secures data by making it unreadable without the encryption key.  
* Passwords are encrypted to protect user data from unauthorized access.  
* Website data is encrypted using HTTPS (HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure) to secure transmission.  
* Individual files can be encrypted using software like WinZip.  
* Internal and removable drives can also be encrypted for added security.

**Firewall**

* Inspects incoming and outgoing network traffic based on a defined set of rules  
* Can drop packets of data if they don’t match the filtering criteria (IP addresses, ports, etc.).  
* Can be software-based or hardware-based.  
* Can filter out malicious or unwanted IP addresses and block inappropriate websites/blacklisted words  
* Drawback: Dedicated hardware firewalls are expensive, and software firewalls may slow down the system.

**Password Policies**

* Ensures strong passwords to protect systems and prevent unauthorized access.  
* Minimum password length, inclusion of uppercase and lowercase letters, symbols, and periodic password changes are common requirements.  
* User authentication ensures that only authorized users access the system.  
* Error messages may indicate that the password doesn't meet the required criteria.

**Physical Security**

* Protects hardware, software, and networks through physical means.  
* Common methods:  
  * CCTV and security cameras  
  * Intruder alarms  
  * Security lighting  
  * Fences, walls, and barbed wire  
  * Security guards and ID cards  
  * Turnstiles and gates  
* Protects against physical access to critical systems and information.

**User Access Levels**

* User Access Levels control who can read, write, or modify files.  
* Some users may have less access (e.g., read-only), while others have full access (read/write).  
* Access rights are set on disks, folders, and individual files.

- System software is the software that provides a platform for other software to work  
- An operating system (OS) is a collection of software that manages a computer’s hardware and software resources, providing common services for computer programs and acting as an intermediary between applications and hardware  
- Operating systems manage computer hardware, users and the resources used by software

- They are responsible for managing:

  - The user **interface**

  - Multitasking (**CPU** management) & **Memory** management

  - **Peripheral** management and drivers

  - **User** management

  - **File** management

  UM: PUF

- The UI:  
  - Provides an interface for users to interact with the computer.  
  - Enables running programs, managing files, and navigating the system.  
  - Types of UIs:  
    - Graphical User Interface (GUI): Visual elements (WIMP)  
    - Menu-Driven Interface: Users select items from predefined lists (e.g., ATMs).  
    - Command Line Interface (CLI): Text-based, for more experienced users  
- Multi-Tasking:  
  - Multitasking allows multiple tasks/processes to run simultaneously.  
  - Examples: web browser, music, and messaging at the same time  
  - Background processes (e.g., updates/security checks) run while the user works.  
  - The OS schedules tasks with time slicing and priority levels.  
  - The scheduler decides how long each process gets CPU time.  
  - Ensures efficient use of system resources.  
- Memory management:  
  - Ensures processes run without conflicts.  
  - Moves programs from storage (SSD) to RAM for CPU access   
  - Tracks where programs are stored in memory  
  - Prevents programs from overwriting each other.  
  - If RAM is full, virtual memory is used to keep processes running.  
  - Prevents system crashes.  
- File Management:  
  - Organizes and manages stored data.  
  - Tracks file locations and prevents accidental overwriting.  
  - Handles file operations like naming, saving, moving, copying, and deleting files  
- Drivers/Peripheral:  
  - Device drivers allow the OS to communicate with peripheral devices (e.g., printers, keyboards, graphics cards).  
  - The kernel manages hardware resources and enables OS-device communication.  
  - Many drivers are built into the OS; others may need to be installed manually  
  - Drivers translate OS commands into device-specific instructions.  
- Users:  
  - The operating system is responsible for managing user logins and passwords.  
  - It stores all users and their passwords in a file or database.  
  - If a computer is used by multiple people, each user can only access their own files.  
  - Users and system administrators have different levels of access rights.  
  - Some users may have read-only access to files, but cannot edit them.

**1.5.2:**

- The operating system controls and manages the computer system.  
- Utility programs perform housekeeping tasks to keep the computer running efficiently.  
- These utilities are often included with the operating system  
- Some utilities, like antivirus software, are sold separately as standalone programs.  
- **Data Compression Software:**  
  - Reduces file size by eliminating unnecessary data or using more efficient data representation.  
  - Saves storage space, allowing more files to be stored within the same capacity.  
  - Decreases data transmission time, improving transfer speeds and reducing bandwidth usage  
  - Helps meet file size limits for email attachments.  
- **Disk Defragmentation Software:**  
  - Reorganizes fragmented files so that related data is stored together in contiguous (adjacent) locations.  
  - Reduces the movement of hard drive parts, speeding up file access and improving system performance.  
- **Encryption Software:**  
  - Data is secured by converting readable information into unreadable code, only accessible with the decryption key.  
  - Protects sensitive data from unauthorized access, especially if the device is lost or stolen.
